# Making the world's largest petri dish and simulating a world war

The original plan was to grow a mosquito under a controlled setting, select an ideal specimen and allow it to feed on me and then encase it alive in some melted amber, mold it into a ball shape and sand it to a clear finish and attach it to a cane, drill a hole in the said amber, and then extract the blood and replicate using a thermocycler, then storing it in close proximity to some radioactive material to encourage further mutation by errors from replication and mutagen exposure, but since I started this long run on sentence with the phrase, 'the original plan was...' that means that was not what happened.

Due to humanity's inability to prevent climate change, we suffered from negative celcius temperatures throughout the last few weeks, and even today is projected to be -2 at night. This unexpected 3rd winter in mid March has prevented proper growth of the mosquitos nor even the chance to capture one in the wild (the only time in my life I actually wanted mosquitos earlier in the year). So although the initial plan to measure an increased mutation incident compared to spontaneous mutations (about a rate of 1 in 10^5 to 10^8) was a cool plan and I will pursue when the weather gets warmer, I am forced to delay this plan.

So we move on to our backup plan of world domination. Kinda cliche, I know, but its a traditional plan with a bit of a twist. I got my inspiration from some games like a board game called Risk and an interactive game called Plague. Both rely on using strategy to take over the world or at least the most area while fighting against other players or the game that is trying to prevent you from expanding. So by introducing bacteria as the intelligence behind the players, they will strive to conquer the world. Bacteria growth patterns have fascinated me ever since I've seen them create links that are the most efficient between nodes, which can represent intercity traffic routes or even slime molds that seek out food in mazes.
