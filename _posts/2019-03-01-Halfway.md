title: Halfway: Final project?

# Jurassic Park or World War simulation

For my final project I have two concepts I am thinking of conducting experiments with. The first is the iconic "Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didnâ€™t stop to think if they should." idea, where I will capture a mosquito and raise it under lab conditions, allow it to feed on me, harvest the blood and then place the mosquito in amber(thanks to Fab Lab O in Shanghai), and then proceed to mess around with the blood like replicating it in the PCR machine or using radioactive tritium to mutate it and see what happens.

The second idea is to lasercut a world map and play god. Like the board game Risk, I will randomly culture microbes and then randomly place them on the world map shaped petri dish with medium and then let them do what with. I will try to give them ideal conditions to grow in and watch as they grow and conquer the land, meet other civilizations and record the inevitable and pitful conflict. Then, when I am bored, I will burn it all down with a homemade blowtorch.

I am on my way to become an evil scientist.
