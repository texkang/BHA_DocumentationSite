# My documentation to become an evil scientist

## BHA6 First Week

Alright so here we go, BioHack Academy 6.
I am not a biologist nor have I done particularily well in school in regards to the subject matter, as my TA would be eager to prove this point when I show up to this office hours and he just sighs. 
However that should not and will not dissuade me in pursuing biohacking as a means to both improve my knowledge and increase my potential as well as fulfill my one of my life long goals of becoming an evil scientist.
The FabAcademy has had surely helped in this endeavor and now armed with the knowledge of future fabrication techniques I wish to expand my capabilities by demonstrating the many experiments to be conducted in the BioHack Academy.
